# Welcome to My GitHub! 🎉
## 👋 Hi, I’m Mariel!
👀 I am a CA accredited professional who has spent the last 3 years advising clients on taxation and financial reporting strategies. 👩🏽‍💼📊 
But the world of numbers has called me to new adventures, and so I have been diving headfirst into the exciting realms of coding and data science! 💻📈
My journey has been a thrilling ride - from balancing books to balancing algorithms I am always keen to learn new things and drive my future.
As a business and tax advisory professional, I developed a keen eye for detail and a knack for problem-solving. 
Now, I'm channeling those skills into uncovering hidden patterns in data!

⚡ Fun facts: When I'm not writing code you can find me in personal photography and videography projects 📷, playing games 🎮,
or finding the best new places to eat. 🍴
